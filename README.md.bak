# Second Order AI - New layer of LLM app

# Features

- Integrate Vercel AI chat AI with AI gateway gpt-5-mini, gpt-5.2, gpt-5.1-thinking, with OpenAI API Key $19 credits
- Implement basic meta thinking prompt, dynamic thinking layer
- Solver builder and Solver with Tools
- Create a multi-step, self-improving process, making a system that autonomously audits its own progress
- Maximise the LLM’s world knowledge DB to reach the goal, uncover the hidden info and knowledge
- Harnesses what the LLMs contain for better reasoning and problem solving
- Self learning Memory
- Automatically selecting combinations of models and approaches
- Design a meta-system to produce optimized agents to automate the extraction of knowledge for hard tasks that require complex reasoning

# What is it?

- Thinking of thinking / Meta thinking
- Dynamic thinking layer on top of LLM
- Adaptive Chain of thoughts
- Analyse the prompt / question / goal to generate extra context, skills to use, tools to use, refined question / goal
- Judge Agent to choose the best input to execute and generate plan using worker agent
- Automate context engineering
- The challenge lies in discovering a reasoning strategy that can both find the necessary pieces of information and assemble them when they are discovered to intelligently determine what information is needed next
- Discovering, appropriate reasoning strategies that are both adaptive to the underlying LLM and work within specified real-world constraints (budgets, tokens, or compute)
- developing better strategies for determining what to ask, refining sequential chain-of-questions, and devising fundamental new methods for assembling the answers

# Iterative problem-solving loop

- generate a potential solution
- receives feedback
- analyzes the feedback
- and then uses the LLM again to refine it
- self-improving process allows us to incrementally build and perfect the answer.

# Self-auditing overview monitoring process

- autonomously audits its own progress
- decides for itself when it has enough information and the solution is satisfactory,

# Meta-Thinking in AI

Meta-thinking in AI refers to the hypothetical or theoretical capability of an artificial intelligence system to reflect on its own cognitive processes, decisions, or learning mechanisms. This concept draws inspiration from human metacognition, which involves planning, monitoring, and evaluating one's own thinking during tasks such as problem-solving or learning.

Key Aspects

1. Self-Monitoring: The AI observes and evaluates its own performance or outputs in real-time, identifying potential issues or areas for improvement.
2. Self-Evaluation: It assesses the quality, correctness, or appropriateness of its decisions, much like a human might review their work for errors or biases.
3. Adaptive Learning: The AI uses insights from self-reflection to improve future performance, modify its strategies, or even adjust its own architecture dynamically.
