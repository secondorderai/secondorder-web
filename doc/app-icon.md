# SecondOrder App Icon — Design Notes

## Concept
The icon is a minimal black-and-white mark that visualizes meta-cognition. It uses
concentric circles to suggest a system that can observe itself, with a small
orbital dot to represent the active observer within the system.

## Visual Elements
- Rounded square: app-icon friendly silhouette that feels calm and intentional.
- Outer ring: the system boundary and overall capability envelope.
- Inner ring: the reflective layer that inspects reasoning.
- Offset dot: a spark of agency or a watcher that monitors the system.

## Style Rationale
- Monochrome palette: aligns with the landing page and OpenAI-like minimalism.
- Thin strokes: light, technical feel without visual noise.
- Simple geometry: scalable for small sizes and retina crispness.

## Usage
- Stored at `app/icon.svg` so Next.js can use it for the favicon and app icon.
- Dark-mode version lives at `app/icon-dark.svg` with inverted colors.
- PNG exports are available in `public/icons/` for 64, 128, 256, and 512.
